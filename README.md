# SillyTavern Extension Stepped Thinking

The extension is intended to provide a kind
of [prompt chaining](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/prompt_chaining) for SillyTavern. The general idea behind
it is to force an LLM to generate a character's thoughts (emotions, plans - whatever you wish) before running the
regular
prompt generation. This increases the overall waiting time for a response in favor of the quality of that response.

## Features

### Implemented

1. An arbitrary number of user-defined prompts to generate a character's thoughts before the regular generation.
2. Configuration of how many messages with a character's thoughts are included in a prompt.
3. The possibility to hide generated thoughts behind a spoiler to create intrigue, if you desire.
4. Removal of extra symbols from thoughts using a customizable regular expression.
5. Isolation of thoughts from different characters in group chats.
6. The ability to exclude a particular character from the thinking process by their name.
7. The ability to allow a particular character to read the thoughts of other characters in group chats.

### Planned

1. Handling swipes on generated thoughts.
2. Customization of prompts for specified characters.
3. Localization in Russian.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

Just open the `Extensions` menu in SillyTavern, then click on the `Install Extension` button.

After that, you may paste the url of this repository to install the
extension: https://github.com/cierru/st-stepped-thinking

### Usage

1. Install the extension.
2. Open a chat (solo or group) and send your message.
3. You will see:
    1. A message from the character under a spoiler that start with "Thinking (CharacterName) ðŸ’­"
    2. A popup notifying you that the character is thinking.
4. Wait until a popup with the text "Done!" raises.
5. Another message from the same character should be generated immediately.

You can also run the thinking process with the `/steppedthinking-trigger` command in solo chats.

### Settings

You can find the extension settings in the `Stepped Thinking` section of the SillyTavern `Extensions` menu.

There are also several settings in `data/default-user/settings.json` of SillyTavern that are not presented in the UI.
You
probably don't want to change them, however there is a list of the settings just in case:

* **thoughts_framing** - characters to enclose thought blocks.
* **thoughts_placeholder** - a placeholder template for the thought blocks container.
* **default_thoughts_substitution** - a stub to put into a thought block while thinking is in progress.
* **thinking_summary_placeholder** - the header of spoilers in thought blocks.
* **max_hiding_thoughts_lookup** - the maximum number of messages to look up for thoughts to hide.

## Prerequisites

The extension has been tested on SillyTavern 1.12.6+ and may not work with other versions.

## Support and Contributions

You are always welcome to contribute to this project. You may create issues, pull requests, and describe them in English
or Russian - whatever is more convenient for you. However, if you want to propose a feature that is not in the "Planned"
section of the README file, please describe your request and reasoning in as much detail as possible.

Special credits to the anon from the /llama thread who described the idea and wrote a PoC of the approach that formed
the basis of this extension. You can familiarize yourself with the results of his efforts
