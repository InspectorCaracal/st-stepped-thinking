# SillyTavern Extension Stepped Thinking

The extension is intended to provide a kind
of [prompt chaining](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/prompt_chaining) for SillyTavern. The general idea behind
it is to force an LLM to generate a character's thoughts (emotions, plans - whatever you wish) before running the
regular
prompt generation. This increases the overall waiting time for a response in favor of the quality of that response.

## Features

### Implemented

1. An arbitrary number of user-defined prompts to generate a characterâ€™s thoughts before regular generation.
2. Configure how many messages with a characterâ€™s thoughts are included in a prompt.
3. Option to hide generated thoughts behind a spoiler to create intrigue, if desired.
4. Remove extra symbols from thoughts using a customizable regular expression.
5. Isolate thoughts from different characters in group chats.
6. Exclude specific characters from the thinking process.
7. Allow certain characters to read the thoughts of other characters in group chats.
8. Assign custom prompt sets to specific characters.

### Planned

1. New UI for thoughts.
2. Regeneration of selected thoughts.
3. "On-Click" mode for generating thoughts.
4. Presets for thinking prompts.
5. Localization in Russian.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

Just open the `Extensions` menu in SillyTavern, then click on the `Install Extension` button.

After that, you may paste the url of this repository to install the
extension: https://github.com/cierru/st-stepped-thinking

### Usage

1. Install the extension.
2. Open a chat (solo or group) and send your message.
3. You will see:
    1. A message from the character under a spoiler that start with "Thinking (CharacterName) ðŸ’­"
    2. A popup notifying you that the character is thinking.
4. Wait until a popup with the text "Done!" raises.
5. Another message from the same character should be generated immediately.

There is an example of how the result may look like:

### Settings

You can find the extension settings in the `Stepped Thinking` section of the SillyTavern `Extensions` menu.

#### New in version 2

Starting from version 2, you can access personal character settings via the bubble icon to the left of the star. The
icon is white by default, but when the setting is active, it turns green.

![character_settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6839807-733d-4abe-91f7-c28cbf336716)

These settings will override the general ones when active. For example, you can disable Stepped Thinking activation for
a particular character or use specific thinking prompts for them. If the `Prompts for thinking` section is empty in the
character's settings, the general prompts will be used.

![character_settings_popup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/133a8f71-4f7c-41ce-b23a-4a06150d1f8a)

Click `Activate` to apply the specified settings, or `Deactivate` to disable them and use the general ones instead. You
can find the full list of active character settings in the regular Stepped Thinking settings menu under the `Character
Settings` block.

### Slash commands

#### /stepthink-trigger

This command is designed to manually trigger the thought generation process. It accepts one optional argument â€” the name of the character for whom the process will be launched, which is particularly useful for group chats.

**Examples:**
- `/stepthink-trigger` â€” triggers thought generation for your companion in solo chats.
- `/stepthink-trigger Seraphina` â€” triggers thought generation for Seraphina.

#### /stepthink-delete-hidden

This command is intended to purge your chat of hidden thought messages. It also accepts an optional argument â€” the name of the character whose thoughts will be removed.  
**Be cautious:** This action cannot be undone!

**Examples:**
- `/stepthink-delete-hidden` â€” removes all hidden thoughts in the current chat.
- `/stepthink-delete-hidden Seraphina` â€” removes all hidden thoughts belonging to Seraphina in the current chat.
